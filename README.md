Fudge chocolate or chocolate fudge is a sugar candy which is everyone's delight. This special type of chocolate is also used in making Fudge Brownies. I've been eating this since my childhood and this dessert has a special place in my heart. It's key ingredients are- cream, sugar and cocoa powder. To make it even more chocolatey we can add more chocolate in the form of flakes, sauce, pieces/chunks etc. It is very different than regular chocolate. It has a unique taste which makes it even more worth trying and tasting. Because of the cream, it's taste becomes a lot more different than the normal milk chocolates. Remember-
Cream skimmed off from the surface of the milk makes a delicious fudge. I, Bhavya Parya, Masterchef Junior really wants you to try it so I've made two markdown files for your convenience, Ingredients.md and Recipe.md.
Good Luck Trying!
