Recipe-
Cream skimmed off from the surface of the milk makes a delicious fudge.

Pour one cup of cream, one cup of sugar, 2 heaped table spoon of cocoa powder and half a tea spoon of soda bicarbonate
Put all these ingredients into a thick bottomed pan and stir over heat till the mixture thickens(considerably 10-15 minutes)
Spread on a greased plate and cut into squares when hard
Enjoy!
